# Reliable Data Transfer Protocol v2.2
This project implements the reliable data transfer protocol RDTv2.2 with the following key characteristics:
• It is a stop-and-wait protocol.
• It uses positive acknowledgment with retransmission.
• It is an alternating bit protocol that uses 1 bit (0 or 1) for packet sequence number
• It tolerates only packet corruption.
• It fails to handle packet loss and packet-out-of-order.
